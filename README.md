PEBSTAAD to Tekla Auto Connections and All Detailing
PEB Steel Structures are designed in STAAD and these are all plate made systems which Tekla Software cannot convert Directly for all required forms.
This set of coding will read the STAAD files designed with Tapered sections and will convert that into the Tekla plugin data which are directly readable through a plugin in Tekla and will prepare all necessary changes whenever required.This plugin in Tekla will communicate with revision controls of STAAD files as and when revised.This plugin in Tekla have the version control system within it which uses mdb file to cross check all changes done in the STAAD file in the process
SAAGIRID is Structural Analytical Algebraic Activities Geometrically verified to Integrate Regularize and Intelligent Designing of Civil Structures
This is a painful area in Structural Engineering for STEEL Structures made with Hybrid systems
